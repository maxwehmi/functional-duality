We have reached the following main objectives: we created a library for lattices and topological spaces, encoding Distributive Lattices and Priestley Spaces along with their structural isomorphisms. We implemented a Haskell translation between these structures and constructed arbitrary instances to run \texttt{QuickCheck} tests. Additionally, implemented a the \texttt{main} executable as a command-line interface, complemented by a parser for improved accessibility. When running \texttt{main}, users can visualize input structures, retrieve their duals, and verify isomorphisms between a structure and its dualâ€™s dual.

The project focuses on finite structures, but our implementation can hopefully allow for future expansion to infinite cases. In conclusion, we hope this implementation proves useful and that readers can leverage it to deepen their understanding of both the theory and applications of this area of mathematics.
