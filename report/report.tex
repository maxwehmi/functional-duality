\begin{abstract}

The aim of this project is to provide a Haskell implementation for the Duality-theoretic translations between Distributive lattices and Priestley spaces.

In order to do so in Section 2 we define relevant mappings. In section 3 we encode partially ordered sets in Haskell, making use of the Data.set library. In section 4 we offer an implementation for Distributive lattices based on the on partially ordered set construction. In section 5 we define Priestley spaces in Haskell. In section 6 we effectively implement translations between Priestley spaces and Distributive lattices.




% We give a toy example of a report in \emph{literate programming} style.
%The main advantage of this is that source code and documentation can
%be written and presented next to each other.
%We use the listings package to typeset Haskell source code nicely.

The repository of the project can be found at https://github.com/maxwehmi/functional-duality.
