The aim of this project is to provide a Haskell implementation for the Duality-theoretic translations between Distributive lattices and Priestley spaces.

In order to do so Section 1 deals with function encodings. Section 2 introduces posets as foundational structures. Sections 3 and 4 implement distributive lattices and Priestley spaces, respectively. Section 6 integrates these components, defining dualities and transformations. 
For user guidance on running the program, see Section 8. Section 9 presents tests and examples. We conclude with section 10.

% We give a toy example of a report in \emph{literate programming} style.
%The main advantage of this is that source code and documentation can
%be written and presented next to each other.
%We use the listings package to typeset Haskell source code nicely.
The repository of the project can be found \href{https://github.com/maxwehmi/functional-duality}{here}.
